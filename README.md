== Synacor Challenge ==
In this challenge, your job is to use this architecture spec to create a
virtual machine capable of running the included binary.  Along the way,
you will find codes; submit these to the challenge website to track
your progress.  Good luck!


== architecture ==
- three storage regions
  - memory with 15-bit address space storing 16-bit values
  - eight registers
  - an unbounded stack which holds individual 16-bit values
- all numbers are unsigned integers 0..32767 (15-bit)
- all math is modulo 32768; 32758 + 15 => 5

== binary format ==
- each number is stored as a 16-bit little-endian pair (low byte, high byte)
- numbers 0..32767 mean a literal value
- numbers 32768..32775 instead mean registers 0..7
- numbers 32776..65535 are invalid
- programs are loaded into memory starting at address 0
- address 0 is the first 16-bit value, address 1 is the second 16-bit value, etc

== execution ==
- After an operation is executed, the next instruction to read is immediately after the last argument of the current operation.  If a jump was performed, the next operation is instead the exact destination of the jump.
- Encountering a register as an operation argument should be taken as reading from the register or setting into the register as appropriate.

== hints ==
- Start with operations 0, 19, and 21.
- The program "9,32768,32769,4,19,32768" occupies six memory addresses and should:
  - Store into register 0 the sum of 4 and the value contained in register 1.
  - Output to the terminal the character with the ascii code contained in register 0.
